# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

<!-- BEGIN:user-rules -->
Never touch .env files. Do not create, edit, or delete them. If you need environment variables, just ask the user what the variables inside it are.
When coding, specifically in creating Next.js projects, always run `npm run build` first to ensure there are no errors before moving on.
